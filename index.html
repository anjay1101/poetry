            <b>Rivers Flowed Strong</b>  			<br>				
<br>
A long time ago		<br>
rivers flowed strong 	<br>
with the leaves of <br>
fall, fish danced<br>
along the river nearly<br>
leaping for joy,<br>
enjoying the company of the <br>
slithering Jesus-like<br>
snakes in a time<br>
before we found<br>
God. Branches<br>
polluted rivers. And<br>
the only sounds were <br>
those of all life: <br>
mosquitos clamoring<br>
& water rippling<br>
against eroded rocks<br>
with the occasional <br>
tweet tweet of <br>
a bird mocking <br>
another one,<br>
and flaming red<br>
& bright blue dragon flies<br>
chasing each-other across<br>
the serene day. <br>



<br><br><br>





And now, children dance <br>
in the glitter of Sunday afternoon sunlight reflecting off the gentle September water. <br>
<br>
But, with our petrol<br>
plastic canoes, and<br>
our glass and metal<br>
cans, we are just skipping stones<br>
across the broken bones <br>
of a land that used<br>
to be alive with life. <br>
<br>
And, <br>
there’s no telling how<br>
much longer the river <br>
will run for, before its<br>
intoxication seeps all<br>
life from the banks and<br>
we’re left stranded with<br>
no place for dogs to play & <br>
no place for rain to stray and <br>
no child will be able to say <br>
they know what it means when a <br>
river flows strong with life. <br>
<br>

            <b> You never told me how to make a change </b>

In cold October, hands get used to being
tucked into pockets, and sweaters colored like
the falls of the past flood the paths. 

People learn to walk briskly away from 
their fears again, no longer wandering with the weather, 
and lips tighten, not willing to sacrifice any sliver of warmth. 

Cold rain fills the streets, soaking socks falsely 
protected by shoes, and feet remain as ghosts until 

Humans rush past archaic wood frames into warmed air that
itself flees into the freedom of winter. 

Darkness collapses like leaf covered sidewalks 
slowly transform into dirty brown human creations.  

And, branches burn when they hug the dried air 
no choice between fight or flight. 

·      ·      ·      ·      ·  

I left my window open, hoping for the cold 
to invigorate change but then, found my hands 
in pockets, a yellow sweater on, just one of a 
crowd of scrambling birds.
