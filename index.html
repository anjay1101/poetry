            <b>Rivers Flowed Strong</b>  			<br>				
<br>
A long time ago		<br>
rivers flowed strong 	<br>
with the leaves of <br>
fall, fish danced<br>
along the river nearly<br>
leaping for joy,<br>
enjoying the company of the <br>
slithering Jesus-like<br>
snakes in a time<br>
before we found<br>
God. Branches<br>
polluted rivers. And<br>
the only sounds were <br>
those of all life: <br>
mosquitos clamoring<br>
& water rippling<br>
against eroded rocks<br>
with the occasional <br>
tweet tweet of <br>
a bird mocking <br>
another one,<br>
and flaming red<br>
& bright blue dragon flies<br>
chasing each-other across<br>
the serene day. <br>



<br><br><br>





And now, children dance <br>
in the glitter of Sunday afternoon sunlight reflecting off the gentle September water. <br>
<br>
But, with our petrol<br>
plastic canoes, and<br>
our glass and metal<br>
cans, we are just skipping stones<br>
across the broken bones <br>
of a land that used<br>
to be alive with life. <br>
<br>
And, <br>
there’s no telling how<br>
much longer the river <br>
will run for, before its<br>
intoxication seeps all<br>
life from the banks and<br>
we’re left stranded with<br>
no place for dogs to play & <br>
no place for rain to stray and <br>
no child will be able to say <br>
they know what it means when a <br>
river flows strong with life. <br>
<br>

            <b> You never told me how to make a change </b><br>
<br>
In cold October, hands get used to being <br>
tucked into pockets, and sweaters colored like<br>
the falls of the past flood the paths. <br>
<br>
People learn to walk briskly away from <br>
their fears again, no longer wandering with the weather, <br>
and lips tighten, not willing to sacrifice any sliver of warmth. <br>
<br>
Cold rain fills the streets, soaking socks falsely <br>
protected by shoes, and feet remain as ghosts until <br>
<br>
Humans rush past archaic wood frames into warmed air that<br>
itself flees into the freedom of winter. <br>
<br>
Darkness collapses like leaf covered sidewalks <br>
slowly transform into dirty brown human creations.  <br>
<br>
And, branches burn when they hug the dried air <br>
no choice between fight or flight. <br>

I left my window open, hoping for the cold <br>
to invigorate change but then, found my hands <br>
in pockets, a yellow sweater on, just one of a <br>
crowd of scrambling birds. <br>
