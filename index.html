Rivers Flowed Strong  							

A long time ago		
rivers flowed strong 	
with the leaves of 
fall, fish danced
along the river nearly
leaping for joy,
enjoying the company of the 
slithering Jesus-like
snakes in a time
before we found
God. Branches
polluted rivers. And
the only sounds were 
those of all life: 
mosquitos clamoring
& water rippling
against eroded rocks
with the occasional 
tweet tweet of 
a bird mocking 
another one,
and flaming red
& bright blue dragon flies
chasing each-other across
the serene day. 









And now, children dance 
in the glitter of Sunday afternoon sunlight reflecting off the gentle September water. 

But, with our petrol
plastic canoes, and
our glass and metal
cans, we are just skipping stones
across the broken bones 
of a land that used
to be alive with life. 

And, 
there’s no telling how
much longer the river 
will run for, before its
intoxication seeps all
life from the banks and
we’re left stranded with
no place for dogs to play & 
no place for rain to stray and 
no child will be able to say 
they know what it means when a 
river flows strong with life.
